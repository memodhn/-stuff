Quantum collapsing state

 However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results 
in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. 
With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.
